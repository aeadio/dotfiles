# dotfiles

My dotfiles. I use MacOS as a daily driver, and the main branch holds that configuration. Void Linux config is kept in a separate branch that is occasionally rebased on main.

As usual, symlinks are set up from the home folder into the relevant files/directories as needed. Symlinks are set up by Ansible.

## How do I use them?

These are my personal dotfiles. If you find something useful here, you are free to use any or all of it under the terms of [0BSD](https://opensource.org/licenses/0BSD) (excepting, of course, any files that attribute credit to another author, and any Git submodules).

Feel free to fork, but make it your own. I make no effort to generalize my setup for consumption and/or remove any assumptions or personal choices.
